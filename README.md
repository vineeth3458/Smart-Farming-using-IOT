# Smart-Farming-using-IOT
This Smart Farming project uses IoT devices with sensors and microcontrollers like Arduino or Raspberry Pi  to monitor and manage agricultural conditions, leveraging technologies such as Wi-Fi, MQTT, and cloud  platforms for real-time data analysis.
Farming has a major impact on the economy of the country. A lot of Research 
has been carried out in the temperature, humidity and the moisture of the soil. This 
project is going to be focused on smart farming as a whole, it is one thing to monitor 
the weather and soil conditions on a farm but it is another thing to control what 
happens with the data that has been captured. I have developed an IOT based smart 
farming solution using various sensors whereby farming conditions are not only 
monitored but a decision is made by the system on what to do with the data gathered 
based on the threshold values that have been set and the data is automatically updated 
on a Arduino server and a website giving live feedback using graphs and charts. This 
is a unique and new approach unlike other methods introduced before. This project 
is aimed at improving the farming system to make it easier by automating it and 
controlling the variables on the farm.
